# Time Series Electrode Inversion Detection using Deep Learning
## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting electrode inversions in time series data using deep learning techniques. The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to develop a reliable system that can automatically detect and flag electrode inversions, which are critical for maintaining data integrity and ensuring accurate analyses in various scientific and medical applications.

## Result
- My best model is in the file "best_model.h5", you can load and use it.
- To run the notebook from scratch, you need to download the data folder.s
