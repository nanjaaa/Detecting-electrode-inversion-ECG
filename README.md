# Time Series Electrode Inversion Detection using Deep Learning
## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting electrode inversions in time series data using deep learning techniques. The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks due to their effectiveness in handling sequential data. The goal is to develop a reliable system that can automatically detect and flag electrode inversions, which are critical for maintaining data integrity and ensuring accurate analyses in various scientific and medical applications.
